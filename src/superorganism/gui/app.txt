 The Superorganism Application

Application View
================

To create an application view, we first need to instantiate the
application itself:

>>> import superorganism.app
>>> app = superorganism.app.Application({})
>>> superorganism.interfaces.IApplication.providedBy(app)
True

Now we also need a screen to render anything on. The screen mock already
implements IScreen:

>>> import superorganism.gui.tests
>>> screen = superorganism.gui.tests.Screen()
>>> superorganism.gui.interfaces.IScreen.providedBy(screen)
True

We can now adapt the view.

>>> import zope.component
>>> view = zope.component.getMultiAdapter((app, screen), name='dashboard')

Before we test any methods on the view, we verify if the view implements
it's interface:

>>> import zope.interface.verify
>>> import superorganism.interfaces
>>> zope.interface.verify.verifyObject(
...     superorganism.gui.interfaces.IDashboard, view)
True

Let's render the initial dashboard screen. Most of the widgets are only
set for testing purposes, but we want to try if we can see the rendered
widgets on the screen.

>>> view.render()
(helpbar) Topbar
...
(statusbar)

We can also change the statusbar text:

>>> view.statusmsg = u'Foobar'
>>> view.render()
(helpbar) Topbar
...
(statusbar) Foobar
