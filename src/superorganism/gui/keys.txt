=========================
 KeyDispatcher and Views
=========================

The key dispatcher is a utility, which basically encapsules the main
loop. Similar to a publisher on a webserver, he notifies the event
system with which key was pressed. The event system and it's subscribers
then, can determine if widgets receive the key event or if new anything
else happens (e.g. views are created).

Setup
=====

We instantiate a Keydispatcher as a regular object with the screen:

>>> import superorganism.gui.tests
>>> import superorganism.gui.keys
>>> screen = superorganism.gui.tests.Screen()
>>> dispatcher = superorganism.gui.keys.Dispatcher(screen)

Verifying the Interface
=======================

We quickly verify if the dispatcher implements it's interface:

>>> import zope.interface.verify
>>> import superorganism.gui.interfaces
>>> zope.interface.verify.verifyObject(
...     superorganism.gui.interfaces.IKeyDispatcher, dispatcher)
True

Running
=======

In order to successfully test, but stop the dispatcher from continously
running, we subscribe to a keypress event:

>>> import zope.component
>>> @zope.component.adapter(superorganism.gui.interfaces.ICharKeyPressEvent)
... def handle_keypress(event):
...     raise ValueError(event)

We register the subscriber with the component modell:

>>> zope.component.provideHandler(handle_keypress)
>>> import zope.component.event

We can start the dispatcher with the run function. It'll basically not
stop until it receives an exception raised:

>>> dispatcher.dispatch_key_events()
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: <superorganism.gui.keys.CharKeyPressed object at 0x...>
