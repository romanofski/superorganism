 KeyDispatcher
===============

Kim Chambers is a very good assistent. She can use the computer keyboard
like nobody, earning also a lot of money winning typing games. Her job?
KeyDispatcher. She knows the keyboard like no one else and can hear
which key was pressed.

>>> import superorganism.gui.keys
>>> kim = superorganism.gui.keys.KeyDispatcher()

Mr. Cameron sneeks in the office today. While Kim is on the phone, Mr.
Cameron thinks he can play with Kim's Computer watching nude pics of
Betsy Kimer. He types the 'a' key:

>>> a = superorganism.gui.keys.KeyPressedEvent('a')

Mr. Cameron likes to type on the keyboard like Kim, but he only uses the
computer for his dirty little things.

>>> import zope.interface.verify
>>> import superorganism.interfaces
>>> zope.interface.verify.verifyObject(
...     superorganism.gui.interfaces.IKeyPressEvent, a)
True

The sound of the pressed key instantly travels to Kim's ear:

>>> subscriber

She realises, that the 'a' key was pressed and act's accordingly. She
dispatches instantly a new view for the pressed key:

>>> view
