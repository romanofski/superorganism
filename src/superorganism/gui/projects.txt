 Project Views
===============

Projects are container like objects, which hold bug related information.

Setup
=====

Before we start with the test, we create the necessary application
object and a (testing) screen:

>>> import superorganism.app
>>> import superorganism.gui.tests
>>> app = superorganism.app.Application({})
>>> screen = superorganism.gui.tests.Screen()

Adding Projects
===============

Paul arrives at work on Monday morning. His Boss tells him, that he has
to work on a new project: a system for managing people in an aged care
facility. "Yet another management system.", he thinks. He quickly writes
a small spec and starts Superorganism.

>>> import zope.component
>>> view = zope.component.getMultiAdapter((app, screen), name='dashboard')
>>> view.render()
(helpbar) Topbar
...
(statusbar)

He opens Superorganism, presses the "p" key and looks at a simple form
for his input about the new project.

>>> project_form = zope.component.getMultiAdapter(
...     (app, screen), name='newproject')
>>> project_form.render()
(|) Projecttitle
(|) Project Description
...

He fills out the fields about `title` (Adult Care) and a `description`.
Two text widgets allow entering keyword information. He adds two
versions, for the `versions` field and two components for the
`component` field. He navigates to the `Save` button, presses the
`Enter` key, saves the form and the new Project is created.
