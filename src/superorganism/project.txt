:doctest:

Projects provide generel information about a software project (a.k.a.
product).

>>> import superorganism.project
>>> project = superorganism.project.Project('1ADF', 'superorganism buglist',
...     'The list of bugs for superorganism should be visible on the dashboard.')
>>> project
<superorganism.project.Project object at 0x...>

We check if the bug really imports it's interface:

>>> import zope.interface.verify
>>> import superorganism.interfaces
>>> zope.interface.verify.verifyObject(
...     superorganism.interfaces.IProject, project)
True

Adding a project to the application object correctly sets the __parent__
and the name:

>>> app = superorganism.app.Application()
>>> app['foo'] = project
>>> app['foo'].__name__
u'foo'
>>> app['foo'].__parent__ == app
True
